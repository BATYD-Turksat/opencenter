# Where the role map file or directory is.  In the case
# that the role location is a file, the roles maps will be
# loaded from that file.  In the case that the role map is
# a directory, all *.map files will be loaded from the
# directory and applied.  Role maps are in the following
# format:
#
# friendly role name = role[something],recipe[something]
# other role name = role[thing], recipe[blah], role[woof]
#
# default is /etc/roush/roles.d
